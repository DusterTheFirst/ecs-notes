<h2><a class="header" href="#lab-2-problem-2" id="lab-2-problem-2">Lab 2 Problem 2</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Design a function message-to-employee which takes in the kind of data you defined above and
produces a message about the employee’s paycheck. For example if the employee receives a paycheck
every week you should produce “Here is your weekly paycheck!”. Is the template useful here? Why or
why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Define what the data is</strong><br />
Paycheck can be weekly, biweekly, or monthly.</p>
<p><strong>What does it represent?</strong><br />
Paycheck represents how often an employee is paid.</p>
<p>Now that we have it all in our head, we should put it down in a comment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A Paycheck is one of:
; - &quot;weekly&quot;
; - &quot;biweekly&quot;
; - &quot;monthly&quot;
; and represents how often an employee is paid
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have the idea, define some constants (if there are a finite amount).</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme"> (define PC-W &quot;weekly&quot;)
 (define PC-B &quot;biweekly&quot;)
 (define PC-M &quot;monthly&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have the idea and the data, create a template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (paycheck-template pc)
    (cond [(string=? pc PC-W) ...]
          [(string=? pc PC-B) ...]
          [(string=? pc PC-M) ...]))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>...</code>s are not valid scheme, they just tell us that we will come back to them later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Now we can move onto creating a function to tell the employee about their paycheck.</em>
<strong>Always</strong> start by laying out the function you want.</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>message-to-employee</code><br />
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>Paycheck</code><br />
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>String</code><br />
<strong>Description:</strong> <code>Message an employee about when their paycheck arrives.</code></p>
<p>Now that you have it in your head, put it in a comment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; message-to-employee : Paycheck -&gt; String
; Message an employee about when their paycheck arrives
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have the layout of your function, <strong>ALWAYS</strong> write out (at least) 2 check-expect tests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect
    (message-to-employee PC-W)
    &quot;Here is your weekly paycheck!&quot;)
(check-expect
    (message-to-employee PC-B)
    &quot;Here is your biweekly paycheck!&quot;)
(check-expect
    (message-to-employee PC-M)
    &quot;Here is your monthly paycheck!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, we create 3 tests since there are 3 variants of our type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Now that we have it all layed out, we can create a function by pasting our template.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (message-to-employee pc)
    (cond [(string=? pc PC-W) ...]
          [(string=? pc PC-B) ...]
          [(string=? pc PC-M) ...]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to change the <code>...</code>s to something more useful.
<em>In our case, the <code>...</code>s would all become the same thing:</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (message-to-employee pc)
    (cond [(string=? pc PC-W) (string-append &quot;Here is your &quot; pc &quot; paycheck!&quot;)]
          [(string=? pc PC-B) (string-append &quot;Here is your &quot; pc &quot; paycheck!&quot;)]
          [(string=? pc PC-M) (string-append &quot;Here is your &quot; pc &quot; paycheck!&quot;)]))
</code></pre>
<p>Since they are all the <em>same</em>, we can simplify the function down to just one line.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (message-to-employee pc)
    (string-append &quot;Here is your &quot; pc &quot; paycheck!&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>In the end, our template and custom type were not used since they were more or less extrenious,
we did not need to create a custom type for this since there is one code path for every paycheck
type</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#lab-2-problem-3" id="lab-2-problem-3">Lab 2 Problem 3</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Design a function calculate-annual which takes in a Number, representing the amount an employee
makes on a single paycheck, and the data describing how often they receive the paycheck. It produces
a Number with an estimate of their annual wages. For example, if the employee gets their paycheck
once per month you will need to multiply the input number by 12 since there are 12 months in a year.
Is the template useful here? Why or why not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As always, start your function definition with its signature</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>calculate-annual</code><br />
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>Number and Paycheck</code><br />
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>Number</code><br />
<strong>Description:</strong> <code>Estimates how much an employee will earn by the end of the year</code></p>
<p>Now that you have it all out, put it in a comment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; calculate-annual : Number Paycheck -&gt; Number
; Estimates how much an employee will earn by the end of the year
</code></pre>
<p><em>Check expect time!</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect (calculate-annual 4 PC-M) 48)
(check-expect (calculate-annual 34 PC-W) (* 34 52))
(check-expect (calculate-annual 450 PC-B) (* 450 26))
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the check-expects all out, its time to make the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (calculate-annual single-paycheck pc)
    (cond [(string=? pc PC-W) (* single-paycheck 52)]
          [(string=? pc PC-B) (* single-paycheck 26)]
          [(string=? pc PC-M) (* single-paycheck 12)]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, the custom data type is useful since we are able to use the seperate paths to
calculate the paycheck differently</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#lab-2-problem-4" id="lab-2-problem-4">Lab 2 problem 4</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Design data to represent the name of someone who has donated to a charity. Your data should
account for the fact that the donor may wish to remain anonymous. Why can’t we use a String to
represent the anonymous donor? What can we use instead? Don’t forget to follow all 4 steps of the
design recipe for data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing we need to do when defining a data type is to define what it can be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A DonorName is one of:
;   - String
;   - false
; and represents the name of someone donating to charity
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have our data type all layed out for us, we should now create (at least) 2 examples of
the data type.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define DONORNAME1 &quot;Paul&quot;)
(define DONORNAME2 false)
</code></pre>
<p>Once we have some examples we can make a template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (donor-template dn)
    (cond [(string? dn) ...]
          [(boolean? dn) ...]))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, the ...s are there for us to replace later when we copy this template</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#lab-2-problem-5" id="lab-2-problem-5">Lab 2 problem 5</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Design a function email-donor which takes in the type of data you defined above. If the donor is
not anonymous it produces a message to send via email such as “Thank you, Bob!” if the donor’s name
was Bob. If the donor was anonymous it produces false. What kind of data do you need to design in
order to write the signature for this function?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, start your function definition with its signature:</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>email-donor</code><br />
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>DonorName</code><br />
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>String or false</code> (we could make another data type, but to save time I will not)<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> <code>To send a message to the given donor if they are not anonymous</code></p>
<p>Now that you know it, put it in a comment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; email-donor : DonorName -&gt; String or false
; To send a message to the given donor if they are not anonymous
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the signature, we can write some check expects</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect (email-donor DONORNAME1) &quot;Thank you, Paul!&quot;)
(check-expect (email-donor DONORNAME2) false)
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, we can write the function itself, copying the template and replacing the <code>...</code>s</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (email-donor dn)
    (cond [(string? dn) (string-append &quot;Thank you, &quot; dn &quot;!&quot;)]

<p>In our previous text editor, we only used the text as the world state,
limiting us to not be able to move the cursor around the screen</p>

(Such as a String <strong>or</strong> a Number) but it could never store both at
the same time.</p>

we want to store a <code>house-number</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>street</code>, and <code>zipcode</code>.
As with all definitions, we want to start out with a comment describing it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; An Address is a (make-address Nat String String String Nat)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Nat in this case is used to tell us that it is a natural number</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the code snippet, we specify the name, and then a function <code>make-address</code> to create
an address, now to define it in scheme to actually use, we can use the <code>define-struct</code> tool</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define-struct address [house st city state zip])
</code></pre>
<p>Now, once we have <code>define-struct</code>, we can create one using the automatically created <code>make-address</code>
function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(make-address false &quot;hello&quot; 2 -7 true)
</code></pre>
<p>and that would return</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(address false &quot;hello&quot; 2 -7 true)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that this does not match our comment, but scheme cant read our comment, so it doesn't know
better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make sure that we match our address definition, we can make some samples and a more detailed
description of the structure.</p>
<p>The more detailed description looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; and represents someone's address
; - where house is the house number
; - st s the name of the street
; - city is the name of the city
; - state is the abbreviation for the state
; - and zip is the zip code
</code></pre>
<p>and would be placed after the structure definition.</p>
<p>Now that we have a good description, we can make some samples for reference</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define ADDRESS1 (make-address 50 &quot;Rice St&quot; &quot;Wellesley&quot; &quot;MA&quot; 02482))
(define ADDRESS2 (make-address 1 &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; 7))
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the structure defined, we need a way to access the different members of it.
Lucky for us, Scheme creates a bunch of helper functions for us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(address-&lt;field&gt; address)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;field&gt;</code> is replaced by the name of the field defined above. ie.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(address-house ADDRESS1)
</code></pre>
<p>would return 50, since it is the value we put in the structure when we made it
or &quot;constructed it&quot;</p>
<p>We can put all of these helper methods together into a template for future use</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (address-template a)
    (... (address-house a)
         (address-st a)
         (address-city a)
         (address-state a)
         (address-zip a) ...))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, the ...s are there for us to replace later when we copy the template function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another helper function created for us is the <code>address?</code> function which lets us check if
a type is an address.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(address? ADDRESS1) ; true
(address? (make-address false false false false false)) ; also true
(address? 3) ; false
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The second example returned true because scheme does not know about our capitol A Address type and
does not know that we want the fields to be specific types. Because of that, as long as we made a
structure using the <code>make-address</code> function scheme will see it as a structure</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a class="header" href="#making-a-structure-that-uses-another-structure" id="making-a-structure-that-uses-another-structure">Making a structure that uses another structure</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have the address structure created, we can make a student structure that uses our
address structure as one of the fields. To start making our student structure, which will hold a
name, year of graduation, and an address we start with the comment to describe it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A Student is a (make-stdnt String Nat Address)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>We are going to name our structure <code>stdnt</code> to help show that the name of the structure can be
whatever you want</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we have the comment, we need to tell scheme about it, using the <code>define-struct</code> tool</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define-struct stdnt [name gradyr house])
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember the names can be anything we want, but we need to use the same ones defined here
later in our project, <strong><em>NOT</em> the data type</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once we have the structure defined for scheme, we now need to describe each field</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; and represents a student
; - where name is the student's full name
; - grad-yr is the student's graduation year
; - and house is the address where the student lives
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we define 2 sample students:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define STUDENT1 (make-stdnt &quot;Sheev&quot; 4 ADDRESS1))
(define STUDENT2 (make-stdnt &quot;Alice&quot; 1234567789 ADDRESS2))
</code></pre>
<p>As always, after setting up the struct and creating the samples, we should
create a template for us to use later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (student-template s)
  (... (stdnt-name s)
       (stdnt-grad-yr s)
       (address-template (stdnt-house s)) ...))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice how in this template, we also use the address-template. That is because the house
member of the <code>student</code> structure is an <code>address</code> structure, so we need to use the tools from the
<code>address-template</code> to get the data out of the address</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-a-structure-in-a-function" id="using-a-structure-in-a-function">Using a structure in a function</a></h2>
<p>What if we want to use our new fandangled structure in a function? Well, lets try it out!
As always, we can start by making a function, say one that adds one to a student's
year-of-graduation (holds them back)</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#holding-a-student-back" id="holding-a-student-back">Holding a student back</a></h3>
<p>As always, start by laying out the function you want.</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>stay-back</code><br />
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>Student</code><br />
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>Student</code><br />
<strong>Description:</strong> <code>Adds 1 to a student's graduation year.</code></p>
<p>And now we can put that into a nice comment for us to read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; stay-back : Student -&gt; Student
; Adds 1 to a Student's graduation year
</code></pre>
<p>Once we have the comment for the function, we can create (at least) 2 check-expect tests
to verify that it is working how we expect.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect
    (stay-back STUDENT1)
    (make-stdnt &quot;Sheev&quot; 5 ADDRESS1))
(check-expect
    (stay-back STUDENT2)
    (make-stdnt &quot;Alice&quot; 123456790 ADDRESS2))
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, that all looks great, now we have to define the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (stay-back s)
    (+ 1 (stdnt-gradyr s)))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This above code with not work, remember <strong>you cannot modify a structure</strong>. In order to make
a change, you have to create a whole new one, created from the old one with the new value in place
of the old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heres how you would do that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (stay-back s)
    (make-stdnt (stdnt-name s) (+ 1 (stdnt-gradyr s)) (stdnt-house s)))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that we have to re-create the structure with <code>make-stdnt</code> but with the difference being
that the gradyr is now one more than the given</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#changing-the-zip-code" id="changing-the-zip-code">Changing the zip code</a></h2>
<p>As always, start by laying out the function you want.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know it can get repetitive, but your later self with thank you</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> <code>update-zip-for-student</code><br />
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>Student and Nat</code><br />
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>Student</code><br />
<strong>Description:</strong> <code>Update a student's zip code to be a new, given a new zip code</code></p>
<p>And now as a nice concise comment</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; update-zip-for-student : Student Nat -&gt; Student
; Update a student's zip code to be a new, given a new zip code
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the function all layed out, we can start with some check-expects</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect
    (update-zip-for-student STUDENT1 12345)
    (make-stdnt &quot;Sheev&quot; 4
        (make-address 50 &quot;Rice St&quot; &quot;Wellesley&quot; &quot;MA&quot; 12345)))
(check-expect
    (update-zip-for-student STUDENT2 98765)
    (make-stdnt &quot;Alice&quot; 123456789
        (make-address 1 &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; 98765)))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Looks normal, and it is, all that changes is the zip code. This should be easy, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well yes, but we have a lot of writing to do. We can define our function, copying the student
template, but, we cant just update the zip by replacing the last parameter with a new zip code,
cause it takes in a whole structure. We need to make another function that can update the zip in the
structure for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you write a function, try to keep it limited to using only one data type at a time. In
our case, we only use the student structure in this function, and we will make another <code>update-zip</code>
function to handle the address structure</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (update-zip-for-student s new-zip)
  (make-stdnt (stdnt-name s)
              (stdnt-grad-yr s)
              (update-zip (stdnt-house s) new-zip)))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, its time to make the update-zip function. Ill go quick with this one, assuming
you have gotten faster with them aswell.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; update-zip : Address Nat -&gt; Address
; Update the zip code for this address to the given #
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Bam</strong>, theres our signature and description</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect
    (update-zip ADDRESS1 02020)
    (make-address 50 &quot;Rice St&quot; &quot;Wellesley&quot; &quot;MA&quot; 02020))
(check-expect
    (update-zip ADDRESS2 13579)
    (make-address 1 &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; 13579))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Whamo</strong>, we have some check expects</p>
<p>And then we can, very simply, just create the <code>update-zip</code> function</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (update-zip a new-zip)
    (make-address
        (address-house a)
        (address-st a)
        (address-city a)
        (address-state a)
        new-zip))
</code></pre>
<p>It may look like a lot of code, but if you break it down, all it does is create a new
address, give it the house, st, city, and state of the old address, and just replace the
zip with the new zip</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tying-it-together-into-a-text-editor" id="tying-it-together-into-a-text-editor">Tying it together into a text editor</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have learned to use structures, we can put them to good use. We can use them in our
text editor. Remember when we had our text editor, it could type and delete, but you could not move
the cursor around. That was because our world state was a single string: The text that was in the
editor. We had no way of storing the cursor position. Well, using these new hot structures that we
have learned about, that is all about to change.</p>
<p>So. first thing you do with any data type, function, or struct is a simple, one line comment
describing it. In our case, we will make a structure called <code>TextEditor</code> or <code>te</code> for short with the
text and cursor position as members. We can write this out in a comment like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A TextEditor is a (make-te String Nat)
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we know about the text editor, we need to tell scheme about it. (remember, anything after a
<code>;</code> is invisible to scheme and is only for us to read).</p>
<p>We can define the struct as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define-struct te [text cursor])
</code></pre>
<p>And now we can describe the types in the text editor further</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; and represents a text editor
; - where text is the text you have typed
; - and cursor is the index of the cursor
</code></pre>
<details>
<summary>All together they will look as such:</summary>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A TextEditor is a (make-te String Nat)
(define-struct te [text cursor])
; and represents a text editor
; - where text is the text you have typed
; - and cursor is the index of the cursor
</code></pre>
</details>
<p>Now that we have the struct created and layed out. We need to make 2 samples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define TE1 (make-te &quot;hello&quot; 1))
(define TE2 (make-te &quot;ECS&quot; 0))
</code></pre>
<p>Although we don't have time to implement it into our text editor but we can make a simple
function that we may be able to use as the on key handler for our big-bang program. Since it
will handle key events, it take in our world state, in this case the <code>TextEditor</code> structure and the
key event.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; insert-text : TextEditor KeyEvent -&gt; TextEditor
; Insert text the user typed at the cursor's location
</code></pre>
<p>An example check expect could exist as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect (insert-text TE1 &quot;a&quot;)
              (make-te &quot;haello&quot; 2))
</code></pre>

to access an address's st(reet), we can use the helper function <code>(address-st a)</code></p>

              (make-te &quot;ECS&quot; 1))
</code></pre>
<p>We had created a simple structure for the text editor which can hold
both the text and the cursor position.</p>
<p>We have accidentally skipped a step between the <code>TextEditor</code> structure and the
<code>insert-text</code> function. We need to make a template.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#texteditor-template" id="texteditor-template">TextEditor template</a></h3>
<p>We are now going to design the template.

<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (te-template te)
    (... (te-text te)
         (te-cursor te)
         ...))
</code></pre>
<p>Since both of these are <code>primitives</code> or things that we have not defined ourselves,
we do not have to call or make any more templates, we can just use them directly.</p>

<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define BACKGROUND (rectangle 600 200 &quot;solid&quot; &quot;light blue&quot;))

<p>We also know that the font color, font size, and an image for the cursor will stay the same:</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#figuring-out-what-clauses-we-need" id="figuring-out-what-clauses-we-need">Figuring out what clauses we need</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have some constants, we can move to step 2. We need to figure out what
clauses we need.
We will probably need <code>to-draw</code> so that we can draw the world, we want <code>on-mouse</code> so that we can
click and move the cursor around, and lastly we want <code>on-key</code> so we can capture the user's typing
and display it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#our-main-function" id="our-main-function">Our main function</a></h3>
<p>Finally, we are here!!1! We can design our main function. Lets call this <code>microsoft-word</code>
(this might violate tons of trademark law, but we are too cool for trademark law). We also need to
figure out what goes in and what comes out. With most all main functions, they will take in the
<code>WorldState</code> and return a <code>WorldState</code>. And now, we can put it all together with a nice description
as well</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; microsoft-word : TextEditor -&gt; TextEditor
; Starts up a text editor where you can move the cursor
(define (microsoft-word initial-editor)
    (big-bang initial-editor
              [to-draw draw-text-editor]
              [on-mouse curse-of-the-cursor] ; Remember, these can be named whatever we want, as
                                             ; long as we know what they mean
              [on-key insert-text]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the main function and a wishlist of all the functions we want, we can make their
function signatures so we know what we want later when we design them.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#function-signatures" id="function-signatures">Function signatures</a></h4>
<p>Lets define our <code>draw-text-editor</code> signature. Since it is the <code>to-draw</code> handler, it takes in the
<code>WorldState</code> and outputs the drawn <code>Image</code>. We can put it in a nice old comment with a description</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; draw-text-editor : TextEditor -&gt; Image
; Draws the text with the cursor at a certain position
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have <code>draw-text-editor</code>, we can define the <code>curse-of-the-cursor</code>. This function will be
in the clause <code>on-mouse</code>. Because of that, it gives us some special things. As always, it will give
us the <code>WorldState</code> and it will also give us the x and y coordinate of the mouse and a <code>MouseEvent</code>
defining what the mouse did, and it returns a new modified (or not) <code>WorldState</code>. We can plop that
into a handy comment for us.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; curse-of-the-cursor : TextEditor Number Number MouseEvent -&gt; TextEditor
; Change the position of the cursor when you click
</code></pre>
<p>And we had already created the <code>insert-text</code> function last week:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; insert-text : TextEditor KeyEvent -&gt; TextEditor
; Insert text the user typed at the cursor's location
</code></pre>
<h4><a class="header" href="#defining-functions" id="defining-functions">Defining functions</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all of the signatures in our wish list, we can start writing the functions.</p>
<p>We can start with the <code>draw-text-editor</code> function. As always, we need to start with some check
expects.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(check-expect
    (draw-text-editor TE-EMPTY)
    (overlay (beside CURSOR_IMAGE (text &quot; &quot; FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; This will create the blank
                                                                   ; image with just a cursor
    BACKGROUND))
(check-expect
    (draw-text-editor TE1)
    (overlay 
        (beside (text &quot;h&quot;  FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)
                CURSOR_IMAGE
                (text &quot;ello&quot; FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; Here we put the cursor between the `h` and
                                                    ; `ello` since it is a cursor pos 1
    BACKGROUND))
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can go and define the <code>draw-text-editor</code> function body.
So, we want to have 2 states, either there is no text in the editor, or there is some text.
we can check for such using a <code>cond</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [...]
          [...]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to somehow get the text out of the editor structure. We can do so by using our template.
Lets paste it down here so we can use it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (te-template te)
    (... (te-text te)
         (te-cursor te)
         ...))
</code></pre>
<p>To access the text, we can use the <code>te-text</code> helper function from our template.
So we can paste it into the first cond. We need to check it to make sure that its length is &gt; 0,
meaning it is not empty</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(&gt; (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)] ; new
          [...]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can define a simple template of what we will do. Remember, we want to write some text,
the cursor, and then the rest of the text</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(&gt; (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)
           (overlay (beside (text ... FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)    ; new
                            CURSOR-IMAGE                       ; new
                            (text ... FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR))   ; new
                    BACKGROUND)]                               ; new
          [...]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we need to figure out how to draw the text in front of the cursor. We can get a slice of
a string by using the <code>substring</code> function, and use the cursor position to chop it. We want to get
the <code>substring</code> of the <code>te-text</code> from 0 up until <code>te-cursor</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(&gt; (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)
           (overlay (beside (text (substring (te-text editor) 0 ; new
                                             (te-cursor))       ; new
                                   FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)
                            CURSOR-IMAGE
                            (text ...))
                    BACKGROUND)]
          [...]))
</code></pre>
<p>And now that we have the first text, we can do the second text very much the same, except this time,
we don't need to give <code>substring</code> an ending point, because in doing so, <code>substring</code> will just go
until the end.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(&gt; (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)
           (overlay (beside (text (substring (te-text editor) 0
                                             (te-cursor))
                                   FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)
                            CURSOR-IMAGE
                            (text (substring (te-text editor)   ; new
                                             (te-cursor))       ; new
                                  FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR))
                    BACKGROUND)]
          [...]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the text having state, we can work on the section of the function when there
is no text to draw. Since we will draw the same thing every time you have no text, we can extract it
into a constant. We can copy it from our first check expect</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define BLANK-EDITOR-IMAGE
        (overlay (beside CURSOR_IMAGE (text &quot; &quot; FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; This will create the blank
                                                                       ; image with just a cursor
        BACKGROUND))
</code></pre>
<p>and then update our check expect from</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#starting-with-the-balloon-game" id="starting-with-the-balloon-game">Starting with the balloon game</a></h2>
<p>We left off writing a game where the user can make balloons which will fly upwards.
Our game worked and was great, but there is a slight problem, we can only have 2
balloons at a time, and that sucks. We want all the balloons!!!</p>
<p>Currently our Balloon game type is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A BalloonGame is one of:
; - false (no balloons)
; - Posn (balloon)
; - (make-twothings Posn Posn)
; and represents either a screen with no balloons, a screen with a balloon,
; or a screen with two balloons
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, there are the 3 variants, no balloons, one balloon and 2 balloons.
If we wanted 3 balloons what could we do? One option would be to make a 4th variant
and make it something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; - (make-threethings Posn Posn Posn)
</code></pre>
<p>But that method has a problem. First off, we need to make another whole data type <code>threethings</code>
and making data types is <em>so <strong>not</strong> lit</em>. Another problem with this method is every single time
we want to add another balloon, we have to make another variant, and a whole new data type.
<em><strong>UGH</strong></em>.</p>
<p>What if I told you <del>that you lived in a simulation</del> that there is a way to make a data definition
that can hole <em>infinite</em> amounts of data.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#recursive-data-structures" id="recursive-data-structures">Recursive data structures</a></h2>
<p>You saw this coming if you read the title, but what you might not have known is what in the gosh
darn is this fandangled recursion thing? Well, I can hit you with what my friend Merriam Webster
says:</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">recursion (noun)
re·​cur·​sion | ri-ˈkər-zhən
    
    a computer programming technique involving the use of a procedure,
    subroutine, function, or algorithm that calls itself one or more
    times until a specified condition is met at which time the rest
    of each repetition is processed from the last one called to the
    first 
</code></pre>
<p>Ok webster, that's cool and all, but like <em><strong>HUH?</strong></em> what do all those words mean. <em>Procedures</em>?
<em>Subroutines</em>?</p>
<p>It looks like Mr. Webster is a bit too verbose for us, let be break it down.</p>
<p>Recursion is when some <em>thing</em> does itself multiple times. In terms of scheme and our programming
knowledge, there are 2 places where we can use recursion. Functions and structures.</p>
<p>A data structure is recursive when one of the parts of it is the data structure itself. A way to
visualize it is to think of russian nesting dolls (also called Matryoshka):</p>

</details>
<p>Each doll has its outer shell with the paint and
the nice artwork, but if you look inside of them, they have a whole new doll inside.</p>
<p>This outer doll can be thought of as the structure and the paint could be a property of it, much
like the positions in our <code>twothings</code> structure and the doll on the inside would be a whole new two
things struct. Lets try to change our <code>BalloonGame</code> into a recursive structure so that we can have
infinite balloons and it may help to see a concrete example.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#making-a-recursive-structure" id="making-a-recursive-structure">Making a recursive structure</a></h2>
<p>Back to our <code>BalloonGame</code> structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A BalloonGame is one of:
; - false (no balloons)
; - Posn (balloon)
; - (make-twothings Posn Posn)
; and represents either a screen with no balloons, a screen with a balloon,
; or a screen with two balloons
</code></pre>
<p>We can join the single and double data structure variants into one recursive data variant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; A BalloonGame is one of:
; - false (no balloons)
; - (make-twothings Posn BalloonGame)
; and represents either a screen with no balloons, or a screen with at least one balloon
</code></pre>
<p>In the above definition, we replaced the second Posn in the <code>twothings</code> struct with a Balloon,
but what does that entail exactly? Well, now <code>chain</code> our <code>Balloon Gme</code>s together.</p>
<p>We can start with the inside most <code>BalloonGame</code>, the false variant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define NO-BALLOONS false)
</code></pre>
<p>Since the false variant of our data type has no <code>BalloonGame</code> inside of it, it is the end of
the recursion, the center most Matryoshka. But we can now put another doll around it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define ONE-BALLOON (make-twothings (make-posn 10 20) NO-BALLOONS))
</code></pre>
<p>Now our <code>ONE-BALLOON</code> constant is a <code>BalloonGame</code> with one balloon. If we unravel it, or replace
the constants with their actual value so its a bit easier to picture, it will look as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define ONE-BALLOON (make-twothings (make-posn 10 20) false))
</code></pre>
<p>The false at the end signals that that is the end of our recursion. Now if we have 2 balloons, we
can show that like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define TWO-BALLOONS (make-twothings (make-posn 250 93) ONE-BALLOON))
</code></pre>
<p>or unwrapped:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define TWO-BALLOONS (make-twothings (make-posn 250 93) (make-twothings (make-posn 10 20) false)))
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, we have that false at the end to signal that our recursion is done.</p>
<p>Recursion is a lot to wrap your head around, so this could take multiple reads through
(and definitely should), but here are a few more examples of the <code>BalloonGame</code> data structure
for you to gander at</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define NO-BALLOONS false)
(define ONE-BALLOON (make-twothings (make-posn 10 20) NO-BALLOONS))
(define TWO-BALLOONS (make-twothings (make-posn 250 93) ONE-BALLOON))
(define THREE-BALLOONS (make-twothings (make-posn 200 200) TWO-BALLOONS))
(define FOUR-BALLOONS (make-twothings (make-posn 350 26) THREE-BALLOONS))
</code></pre>
<p>And them &quot;unraveled&quot;</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">(define NO-BALLOONS false)

(define ONE-BALLOON
  (make-twothings
    (make-posn 10 20)
    false))

(define TWO-BALLOONS
  (make-twothings
    (make-posn 250 93)
    (make-twothings
      (make-posn 10 20)
      false)))

(define THREE-BALLOONS
  (make-twothings
    (make-posn 200 200)
    (make-twothings
      (make-posn 250 93)
      (make-twothings
        (make-posn 10 20)
        false))))
          
(define FOUR-BALLOONS
  (make-twothings
    (make-posn 350 26)
    (make-twothings
      (make-posn 200 200)
      (make-twothings
        (make-posn 250 93)
        (make-twothings
          (make-posn 10 20)
          false)))))
</code></pre>
<p>In the &quot;unraveled&quot; version — which by the way you should almost never type out by hand,
always use the method shown above it, where you have each nested one get defined before it
— it becomes a bit clearer to see the &quot;nesting&quot; of the structure inside of itself.
It is worthy to note that all of them end in false. If there not a second, non recursive variant
of our data type, we would never to be able to stop recursing, but since we have that second false
variant, we are allowed to stop our data type with the false variant.</p>
<p>Since we have now updated the data definition and its samples (the NO-BALLOONS - FOUR-BALLOONS
above) we can move to the final step of the data defining process, which is to make our template. In
our case, we just need to update our template.</p>
<p>Currently we have this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; BalloonGame -&gt; ???
(define (balloon-game-template game)
  (cond [(boolean? game) ...]
        [(posn? game) (posn-template game)]
        [(twothings? game)
         (... (posn-template (twothings-thing1 game))
              (posn-template (twothings-thing2 game)))]))
</code></pre>
<p>And that template worked for our 3 variants, the no balloons (false), the one Posn, or the 2 Posns.
Since we no longer have 3 variants we have to change the template. We can begin by removing the one
posn template, since although we do use only 1 posn, we still use the <code>twothings</code> struct.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">; BalloonGame -&gt; ???
(define (balloon-game-template game)
  (cond [(boolean? game) ...]
-       [(posn? game) (posn-template game)]
        [(twothings? game)
         (... (posn-template (twothings-thing1 game))
              (posn-template (twothings-thing2 game)))]))
</code></pre>
<p>Now its all fine and dandy? Right? Well not yet... We also changed the data that is
stored in the two things structure. Since we changed our <em>definition</em>, we also need
to change the code that uses it, or the <em>implementation</em>.</p>
<p>In our new data definition for the two things variant, we changed from 2 Posns to a
Posn and another BalloonGame. In our above template, we call the <code>posn-template</code> on the
<code>thing1</code> and the <code>thing2</code> from twothings since they both used to be posns, Now the second
one is another <code>BalloonGame</code> so we have to call this same <code>baloon-game-template</code> on that
baloon game</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">; BalloonGame -&gt; ???
(define (balloon-game-template game)
  (cond [(boolean? game) ...]
        [(twothings? game)
         (... (posn-template (twothings-thing1 game))
-             (posn-template (twothings-thing2 game)))]))
+             (balloon-game-template (twothings-thing2 game)))]))
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we now have our template calling that same template. This is very similar
to our <strong>recursive data structure</strong> in a lot of ways, I wonder what it would be called?</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#recursive-functions" id="recursive-functions">Recursive functions</a></h2>
<p>Recursive functions are very much the same as recursive data definitions. But instead of
containing themselves, as recursive structures do, they call (or run) themselves.</p>
<p>We can see that in practice in our new and updated <code>balloon-game-template</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scheme">; BalloonGame -&gt; ???
(define (balloon-game-template game)
  (cond [(boolean? game) ...]
        [(twothings? game)
         (... (posn-template (twothings-thing1 game))
              (balloon-game-template (twothings-thing2 game)))]))
</code></pre>
<p>Since the function calls itself, it needs a path to take that could not call itself or else
it would be stuck calling itself which would call itself which would....</p>
<p>Just like how a recursive structure needs a second variant a recursive function needs a cond
or if with <em>one or more</em> of the paths <strong>not</strong> calling itself.</p>
<p>This escape can be seen in our template with the boolean? cond case which will run when we get
to the end of our &quot;nested dolls&quot;.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p><a href="python/introduction.html#too-long-didnt-read">Jump to TL;DR (summary)</a></p>
<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of python.
Python is a very different language than scheme/racket which we have used so far.
Almost all of the syntax (or the structure of the language) will be different than how
we have done previous.</p>
<p>Below is a more in depth dive into each aspect of the language</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#math" id="math">Math</a></h2>
<p>Unlike scheme which uses prefix notation for mathematical operations such as <code>(+ 6 8)</code> which would
add 6 and 8 together. Python on the other hand uses infix notation such as <code>6 + 8</code>
which is much more similar to the mathematical notation you have learned before.</p>
<p>To add, subtract, multiply, and divide in python you would do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Addition
1 + 2 # = 3
2 + 4 # = 6

# Subtraction
2 - 3 # = -1
3 - 2 # = 1

# Multiplication
-1 * 2 # = -2
3 * 4 # = 12

# Division
2 / 6 # = .33333
6 / 2 # = 3
</code></pre>
<p>As well as the usual operators, python has a few others.</p>
<p>In math class or when using a calculator, it is common to represent an exponent with the <code>^</code>
character ex: <code>2^6</code> would represent 2 to the power of 6, but that is not the case in python. The <code>^</code>
character already has a meaning as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR</a> operator, which does not matter for this class yet, but
is important to note that python will not throw out code that uses the <code>^</code> character but will just
produce a weird value. Instead, python uses 2 multiplication symbols to denote exponentiation: <code>**</code>.
Some more examples are below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">2 ** 6 # = 64
3 ** 3 # = 27
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes when you divide, you might not care about the decimal or fractional portion of the result
and for that use case, python has the double division <code>//</code> operator for &quot;integer division&quot; or
division without decimals</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">2 // 16 # = 0
10 // 8 # = 1
</code></pre>
<p>And when dividing you might only care about the remainder and for that, python has the modulo <code>%</code>
operator.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">6 % 3 # = 0
7 % 3 # = 1
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#more-math" id="more-math">More Math</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you need more than just the simple operations and for that, python has the math library.
The documentation for the math library can be found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">on the official python docs</a>
but python is a very popular language and is very easily google-able. Do not hesitate to use the
internet whenever you need to reference some docs or look something up.</p>
<p>In order to use libraries, you need to <code>import</code> them. To import the math library you would do as
such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import math
</code></pre>
<p>Functions from a library can be used by putting the library name, a dot, and then the name of the
function. ex: <code>math.sin()</code> would be the sin function in the math library</p>
<p>Here are a few useful but non-exhaustive list of the functions available from the math library.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Trig functions
math.sin(math.pi) # = 0
math.cos(math.pi) # = -1
math.tan(math.pi) # = 0

# Rounding functions
math.floor(10.2) # = 10
math.ceil(10.2) # = 11

# Absolute value
math.fabs(-100) # = 100

# Factorial
math.factorial(4) # = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

# Logarithms
math.log(4) # = ln(4) = 1.3862943611
math.log(100, 10) # = log_10(100) = 2
math.log10(100) # = log_10(100) = 2
math.log(100, 5) # = log_5(100) = 2.8613531161
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">docs</a> have an exhaustive list of all methods available from the
library.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#booleans" id="booleans">Booleans</a></h2>
<p>Just like in scheme, we can also deal with true/false conditions or booleans. These are also used
in python, although their names are capitalized:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">True
False
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in scheme, we can also do logical operations with the booleans, such as <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>
which are used much like they are in scheme, just in infix notation instead of prefix notation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Logical and
True and True # = True
True and False # = False
False and True # = False
False and False # = False

# Logical or
True or True # = True
True or False # = True
False or True # = True
False or False # = False

# Logical not
not True # = False
not False # = True
</code></pre>
<p>There is also a less common logical operation called <code>xor</code> or <code>eXclusive OR</code> which you may never
have to use, but is good to know. It will return <code>True</code> if one and only one of the inputs is <code>True</code>
which can be seen below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">True ^ True # = False
True ^ False # = True
False ^ True # = True

<h2><a class="header" href="#conditionals" id="conditionals">Conditionals</a></h2>
<p>When dealing with numbers, we may want to check if some <em>condition</em> holds true. There are 2
different types of conditionals, equality and inequality. You may remember these from your math
class, but if not here is a refresher.</p>
<p>Equality is the comparison of 2 exact numbers, such as <code>_ is equal to _</code> or <code>_ is not equal to _</code>.
Equality can be expressed in python as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">1 == 2 # = False
6 == 6 # = True

6 != 9 # = True
12 != 12 # = False
</code></pre>
<p>Inequality is checking the relation of 1 number with respect to another or <code>_ is greater than _</code> or
<code>_ is less than _</code>. These operations can be expressed in python as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">1 &gt; 2 # = False
6 &gt; 6 # = False

6 &gt;= 9 # = False
12 &gt;= 12 # = True

6 &lt; 9 # = True
12 &lt; 12 # = False

1 &lt;= 2 # = True
6 &lt;= 6 # = True
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#strings" id="strings">Strings</a></h2>
<p>Similarly to scheme, strings, which are just text, can be created using quotation marks (<code>&quot;</code>) aka
double quotes. But unlike scheme python also lets you use apostrophes (<code>'</code>) aka single quotes to
surround your text. Both act exactly the same.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;Strings can be defined using double quotes&quot;
'or using single quotes'
</code></pre>
<p>When using double quotes, you are allowed to use apostrophes in the text as usual</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;they're late&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>And when using single quotes, you can use double quotes inside of the text with no problem</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">'And then he said &quot;Oh no you did not!&quot;'
</code></pre>
<p>When you want to use both in one string, things get a bit more complex. The quotes that you write
around your string, signal to the language that everything inside of it is text, but when the text
contains the same quote you used to tell the language about the text, the language will mistakenly
see it as you ending the string.</p>
<p>You can see this in the syntax highlighting (coloring) of the code below changing after that quote,
meaning that python would not read this how we wanted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;They're having a lot of fun and yelling &quot;yippee&quot;&quot;
'They're having a lot of fun and yelling &quot;yippee&quot;'
</code></pre>
<p>To get around this issue, we can use what is called &quot;escaping quotes&quot;. If you want to use the
character that you used to make a string (ie. <code>'</code> inside a single quoted string or <code>&quot;</code> inside a
double quoted string) you can put a backslash <code>\</code> character in front of it to tell the language to
treat it as part of the string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">'They\'re having a lot of fun and yelling &quot;yippee&quot;'
&quot;They're having a lot of fun and yelling \&quot;yippee\&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the colors staying the same throughout the string. Both strings above are exactly equal, the
only difference is what quote we are using.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to combine 2 strings, and python allows us to do so using the <code>+</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;Hello&quot; + &quot;world&quot; # = &quot;Helloworld&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We may also want to create a string that has multiple lines of text. We can do so using a multiline
strings which are defined using 3 double quotes</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;&quot;&quot;Hello there
this string
spans across
multiple lines :D&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the newline character <code>\n</code> instead to denote multiple lines in a string</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;Hello there\nthis string\nspans across\nmultiple lines :D&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The above 2 strings are exactly equal, they are just different ways of writing them</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#comments" id="comments">Comments</a></h2>
<p>A lot of the time, code is complicated.
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-reading-code-much-harder-than-writing-it-How-can-I-read-code-and-understand-what-the-code-actually-is-doing-in-Python-to-be-precise">Reading code is 2x harder than writing that same code.</a>
To help ourselves with our programming, programming languages have comments, or lines/sections of
code that are not read by the language, but instead by the programmer. I have been using comments in
these notes with notes and information on what is in the code that I am showing you. These comments
are denoted by a different, dimmer color than the rest of the code.</p>
<p>Comments in python are denoted using the pound sign <code>#</code> aka hash or hashtag.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Cool single line comment
</code></pre>
<p>Comments can appear after code, but any text after the <code>#</code> is interpreted as a comment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">2 + 5 # Cool comment after code
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a comment that spans multiple lines, you can use a multiline comment which will just get
ignored when you run the program since you do nothing with it</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;&quot;&quot;
Weird whacky multiline string acting as a
multiline comment
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>But it is probably better to just use multiple comments, one per line <sup>like a sane person</sup></p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Or just use
# Multiple lines of these
# Like a sane human being
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#turtle" id="turtle">Turtle</a></h2>
<p>You cant have a programming lesson without a bit of fun, so here is our fun for this lesson. We get
to draw! yaay woot woot.... Just me? ok...</p>
<p>In python, we can use the turtle library. The documentation for the turtle library can be found
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">on the official python docs</a> Just like with the math library, we have to
<code>import</code> the library to use it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import turtle
</code></pre>
<p>With all good art, we need color, so we can go ahead and set the color of the turtle with the color
method</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">turtle.color('red', 'yellow')
</code></pre>
<p>To move the turtle, we have 2 options. We can either move in a direction, ie <code>forward</code>, <code>backward</code>,
or we could move to an exact position.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Turtle movement
turtle.forward(10)
turtle.left(120)

# Turtle teleportation
turtle.setx(-100)
turtle.sety(100)
</code></pre>
<p>The coordinates of the canvas that we can draw on are on the x axis, -180 to 180 and on the y axis,
-200 to 200. The center of the screen being 0,0.</p>
<p>We can also stop the turtle from drawing a path, or change its color mid stroke using the functions
below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Turtle pen control
turtle.penup()
turtle.pencolor('red')
turtle.pendown()
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">docs</a> have an exhaustive list of all methods available from the
library.</p>
<p>Remember, python is very google-able, please feel free to google to your heart's content.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#too-long-didnt-read-4" id="too-long-didnt-read-4">Too Long; Didn't Read</a></h2>
<p>If you want an abridged version, you can look at just the code that I have gone over
<a href="https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/ecs-notes/tree/main/src/python/introduction.py">here</a></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#constants-and-functions" id="constants-and-functions">Constants and Functions</a></h1>
<p><a href="python/constants-functions.html#too-long-didnt-read">Jump to TL;DR (summary)</a></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#constants" id="constants">Constants</a></h2>
<p>Starting with some code from the introduction that draws a square</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import turtle
turtle.forward(150)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(150)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(150)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(150)
turtle.done()
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that our code is very repetitive. We call <code>turtle.forward</code> 4 times and <code>turtle.left</code> 3
times. We also give them all the same values to the functions over and over. We can start by getting
rid of the same value over and over and over again using constants, much like we have with scheme.</p>
<p>Constants in python are defined with all caps names and our constants would look something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">SIZE = 150
ANGLE = 90
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in scheme, we use all caps for our constants to show that they will never change. If we
wanted to have a constant with spaces in its name, we would write it like such</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">THIS_IS_MY_CONSTANT = &quot;hello&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>And now that we have these constants defined, we can replace the numbers in our code with these
constants</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">turtle.forward(SIZE)
turtle.left(ANGLE)
turtle.forward(SIZE)
turtle.left(ANGLE)
turtle.forward(SIZE)
turtle.left(ANGLE)
turtle.forward(SIZE)
turtle.done()
</code></pre>
<p>Now we just have one spot to change our size and angle if we want to draw a different shape or to
draw a different size. The code is still repetitive though. If we wanted to draw 2 squares, we would
have 14 lines of code. bruh :(. Instead, we can use</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#functions" id="functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions, which you are hopefully familiar with from scheme, are tools that allow us to group
blocks of code together which we can run and even give values to. In python, we follow the same
steps as in scheme when defining a function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Signature</li>
<li>Purpose/Description</li>
<li><del>Tests</del></li>
<li>Actual Function Body</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, we do all of them <em>except</em> tests. I know, it is so sad. They were my favorite part of
programming too.</p>
<p>Now that we have that out of the way, we can move our code into a function. We start with the
signature. Since this function is drawing a square, I think we should name it <code>draw_triangle</code>. No?
Ok... I guess we can call it <code>draw_square</code>. And we want our function to take in the size of the
square so that we can use it for <sub>small</sub> and <strong>big</strong> squares. Our function's signature
would look something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># draw_square : Number -&gt; Image
</code></pre>
<p>Although, yes, this function does not <code>return</code> an image per se, we will still put it down as such,
to clarify that the function will create an image on the screen. We will get into what it means for
a function to actually return a value later.</p>
<p>And now we can add our very, very complex description or purpose statement whatever you prefer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># draw_square : Number -&gt; Image
# Draws a square of the given size
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the documentation out of the way, we can move onto the actual body of the function.
The function will basically be a copy and paste of our above code with some parts added to tell
python that it is a function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># draw_square : Number -&gt; Image
# Draws a square of the given size
def draw_square(size):
    turtle.forward(size)
    turtle.left(ANGLE)
    turtle.forward(size)
    turtle.left(ANGLE)
    turtle.forward(size)
    turtle.left(ANGLE)
    turtle.forward(size)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the parts of a python function</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def # Tells python about the function definition
draw_square # The name of our function
(size) # Tells python that our function takes in one input, and we name it size
: # Tells python that everything after this is the content of the function
</code></pre>
<p>If we were to take in 2 inputs, we would put a comma in between them in the parenthesis</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def two_inputs(a, b):
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the function, we have replaced <code>SIZE</code> with <code>size</code> since we are no longer using the
constant size that we defined before and instead are allowing us to specify the size of the square
when we call the function</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python is what is called a &quot;whitespace language&quot; meaning that what the code means is heavily
dependant on the whitespace in the code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whitespace is a character that you can not see such as space or tab</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because of this, the indentation of your code matters. To specify that the code above is part of
the function, it needed to be indented one time. If we now wanted to write more code after, but not
inside of the function, we would have to un-indent the code which would look like so</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-python"># draw_square : Number -&gt; Image
# Draws a square of the given size
def draw_square(size):
    turtle.forward(size)
    turtle.left(ANGLE)
    turtle.forward(size)
    turtle.left(ANGLE)
    turtle.forward(size)
    turtle.left(ANGLE)
    turtle.forward(size)

turtle.done() # This code is now not inside of the above function
</code></pre>
<p>To use our function that we have defined, we can now call it as such</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">draw_square(150)
draw_square(300)
turtle.done()
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike in scheme where you can call/use a function from anywhere, in python, you must define a
function before you are able to use it, much like variables or constants. So the above code would
have to appear below the function we have made</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#designing-a-square-root-function" id="designing-a-square-root-function">Designing a square root function</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have designed a simple function, we get to do another one! yay!</p>
<p>This function we will define will find the square root of an inputted value</p>
<p>Lets walk down the steps of function definitions</p>
<ul>
<li>Signature</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># square_root : Number -&gt; Number
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Purpose/Description</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Find the square root of a Number
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><del>Tests</del></li>
</ul>
<p>No tests needed</p>
<ul>
<li>Actual Function Body</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the function, we need to remember how to take a square root. If you remember from math
class, a square root is the same as raising something to the power of <code>1/2</code>, we can express that in
python with the following</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def square_root(n):
    n**(1/2)
</code></pre>
<p>If you remember back to the introduction, the <code>**</code> operator raises the number on the left to the
exponent on the right, so in this case, we are raising n to the power of <code>1/2</code> where n is the
inputted value to our function</p>
<p>Unlike scheme, python does not return anything from the function unless you explicitly tell it to
<code>return</code> the value. That is because in python, you can run multiple lines of code per function where
as scheme had you nest all of the function calls inside each other.</p>
<p>To be able to return the value, we need to add <code>return</code> before the value we want to return. Below is
the fully complete function</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># square_root : Number -&gt; Number
# Find the square root of a Number
def square_root(n):
    return n**(1/2) # n^.5 = sqrt(n)
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use this function</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">square_root(100) # = 10.0
</code></pre>
<p>And we can assign the result to a variable as well</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = square_root(25) # = 5.0
</code></pre>
<p>But how to we show out this information to us? Im not too sure, but I have heard a bit about</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#printing-values-to-the-console" id="printing-values-to-the-console">Printing Values to the Console</a></h2>
<p>Python provides a function to us called print that will print out all of its arguments. This
function is a bit different than the ones that we have wrote so far in that it can take 0 or 100
inputs. Print will print out all of the inputs given to it. We use it like any other function that
we have before</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;hello&quot;)
print(&quot;hello&quot;, 7, False, 32)
print(square_root(100))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Watch out! Although python is very google-able, there are 2 different versions of python: Python 2
and Python 3. There are a few syntax and other changes between these versions, one of these is the
layout of the print function. In Python 2, you would write <code>print &quot;hello&quot;</code> to print the string
hello. In the newer Python 3 that we use, we need to put parenthesis around the inputs to all
functions, so we would write <code>print(&quot;hello&quot;)</code>. <strong>If you ever see the old way of printing, look
around for a newer source since the source you are using may be outdated, or just replace the old
style of prints with the new style.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#returning-nothing" id="returning-nothing">Returning Nothing</a></h2>
<p>When writing a function, we may want to not return anything from it since we might print to the
console or draw using a turtle. In that case, we need to mark the function as returning <code>(void)</code>.</p>
<p>We will use a simple function that prints a greeting to the name that is given ie.
<code>print_greeting(&quot;Zach&quot;)</code> would print <code>Hello Zach</code> to the console as an example for this.</p>
<p>The function signature and usage would look as follows</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># print_greeting : String -&gt; (void)
# Prints a greeting to the given person
def print_greeting(name):
    print(&quot;Hello &quot; + name)

print_greeting(&quot;Alice&quot;) # prints &quot;Hello Alice&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Make note of the un-indentation of the last line, meaning that it is not inside of the function
above it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main change we have made is the return type being <code>(void)</code> to tell us that this function returns
nothing.</p>
<p>Since this function returns nothing, we cannot get a value from it/assign it to a variable</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">greeting = print_greeting(&quot;Alice&quot;)
print(greeting) # prints &quot;None&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If we instead wanted to be able to use and manipulate the greeting before printing it out, we would
need to make our function return the greeting instead of printing it. Since it now returns the
greeting instead of printing it, we can rename it to <code>get_greeting</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># get_greeting : String -&gt; String
# Get a greeting to the given person
def get_greeting(name):
    return &quot;Hello &quot; + name

get_greeting(&quot;Alice&quot;) # = &quot;Hello Alice&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the last line does not print anything to the console, and instead just will return the
greeting for use to use later in our program. We can use the value like so</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">greeting = get_greeting(&quot;Alice&quot;)
print(greeting + &quot;'s dog&quot;) # prints &quot;Hello Alice's dog&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mutation" id="mutation">Mutation</a></h2>
<p>This is a very common feature that scheme intentionally did not let us use, and that is because it
has a lot of quirks, but can also be very useful.</p>
<p>We can define variables like such</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 7
</code></pre>
<p>And in python, we can now change that variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 7
x = 10
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>So in the console, we will see the number 10, since <code>x</code> was changed from 7 to 10</p>
<p>Sometimes we don't want to change a variable to an exact value, but instead change it relatively
such as adding 5 to it. Python lets us to so in 2 ways. The obvious way would be to do something
like</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = x + 3
</code></pre>
<p>But python gives us the tool to do it a bit more concisely using</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x += 3
</code></pre>
<p>Python lets us do this with all of the operators gone over in the introduction, here is an example
of a few of them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x -= 3 # subtracts 3 from the value x
x *= 3 # multiplies 3 to the value x
x /= 3 # divides 3 from the value x
</code></pre>
<p>Weirdly, we can use these with strings too</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">s = &quot;Hello&quot;
s += &quot;!&quot; # Adds a &quot;!&quot; at the end of the string s
s *= 3 # Duplicates the string s 3 times
print(s) # prints &quot;Hello!Hello!Hello!&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mutation-madness" id="mutation-madness">Mutation Madness</a></h2>

<pre><code class="language-python"># change_number : Number -&gt; (void)

def change_number(x):
    x += 3
</code></pre>
<p>And this code that deals with the function</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 10
change_number(x)
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>What do you think this would print?</p>
<details>
<summary>Click for the answer</summary>
<p>This would print out 10.</p>
<p>The x in the function and the x in the code outside of the function are not the same variable. Yes
they have the same name, but the one inside of the function could just as well be named <code>n</code> or
<code>jeff</code>.</p>
<p>The variables that are passed to a function cannot be modified by the function. But they can modify
the data in the function themselves.</p>
<p>If we wanted to actually give the changed value back to the code that called this function, we would
need to return it back out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># change_number : Number -&gt; Number
# Add 3 to the given Number
def change_number(x):
    x += 3
    return x

<p><a href="python/lists.html#too-long-didnt-read">Jump to TL;DR (summary)</a></p>
<p>Lists in python are very simple to create. They are specified by a square bracket <code>[</code>, a comma
separated list of the data you would like, and a closing square bracket <code>]</code>. Below are a few
examples of lists.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">MY_FIRST_LIST = [0, 1, 2]
MY_SECOND_LIST = [&quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;Hubert&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Lists alone are pretty cool, but we sometimes might want to get a single value from a list.
To do so, we need to use some more square brackets. This time, our square brackets go after the name
of the list, and within them is the <code>index</code> of the value we want.</p>
<p>If I had a list <code>MY_LIST</code> and wanted to get the 2nd element, I would write <code>MY_LIST[1]</code>. And yes,
that is not a typo, you use the number 1 to refer to the 2nd element. Why is that? Well it has to do
with a whole lot of how computers work, but the main thing to remember is that <code>1</code> is not the first
element, <code>0</code> is.</p>

<p>Lists in python are what are called 0 indexed lists, or their first value has the index of 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another example of getting data from a list</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">FRUIT_WORDS = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;bananna&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;]

print(FRUIT_WORDS[0]) # Prints &quot;apple&quot;
print(FRUIT_WORDS[1]) # Prints &quot;bananna&quot;
print(FRUIT_WORDS[2]) # Prints &quot;cherry&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mutation-1" id="mutation-1">Mutation</a></h2>
<p>Just having a list of items is cool, but what if we want to change what is in the list? Well that is
where list mutation comes into play.</p>
<p>There are a few ways we can mutate a list. We can change the value stored in one of the indexes,
like so</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">fruit_words = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;bananna&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;]

FRUIT_WORDS[1] = &quot;berries&quot; # Changes &quot;bananna&quot; to &quot;berries&quot;

print(FRUIT_WORDS[1]) # Prints &quot;berries&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how the list's name is <code>lower_snake_case</code> instead of <code>UPPER_SNAKE_CASE</code> since it is mutable
or not constant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, we can add items to the end of the list, with the <code>append</code> method</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_list = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
my_list.append(&quot;d&quot;)
print(my_list) # Prints &quot;['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><code>print</code> can print out whole lists for us which is useful for making sure the list has what we
think it has in it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as adding items to lists, we can remove items.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_list.remove(&quot;b&quot;)
print(my_list) # Prints &quot;['a', 'c', 'd']&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WATCH OUT</strong> <code>remove</code> takes in the value to remove, not the index</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#length" id="length">Length</a></h2>
<p>We all know the size of your list is not what matters, but instead how you use it. Sometimes it is
useful to know its length every once and a while though. Luckily for us, python provides a handy
dandy <code>len</code> function, the same one we have been using to get the length of a string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">FRUIT_WORDS = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;bananna&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;]

print(len(FRUIT_WORDS)) # Prints &quot;3&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#looping" id="looping">Looping</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, just getting one element is not enough for us, and instead we want to do something with
or to the whole list. To do so, we can use a loop to go over each element of the list, and do
something. The simplest thing to do is to just print out each element in a list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">FRUIT_WORDS = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;bananna&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;]

for fruit in FRUIT_WORDS:
    print(fruit) # Will print each name in the list
</code></pre>
<p>We might also want to produce a single value based on all the items in the list, such as a sum.
Let's make a function to calculate the sum of a list of numbers. Its signature would look as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># sum : ListOfNumbers -&gt; Number
# Sums up all the numbers in a list of numbers
def sum(list_of_numbers):
</code></pre>
<p>Since we need a place to store our sum, we will create a variable and call it <code>result</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    result = 0 # We start with a sum of 0
</code></pre>
<p>And then we can loop over every element</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    for n in list_of_numbers: # Loop over every number `n` in the list
        result += n # Add the current number to the sum
</code></pre>
<p>And then finally, we can return the result, leaving us with</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># sum : ListOfNumbers -&gt; Number
# Sums up all the numbers in a list of numbers
def sum(list_of_numbers):
    result = 0 # We start with a sum of 0

    for n in list_of_numbers: # Loop over every number `n` in the list
        result += n # Add the current number to the sum

    # Note the un-indentation, since this return is outside of the for loop
    # If the return was inside of the for loop, the function would return the
    # sum after only adding the first value, basically returning the first value
    return result # Give the result to the caller
</code></pre>
<p>If we were to use our function, we could do so as such:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">sum([0, 2, 3, 4]) # = 9
sum([6]) # = 6
sum([15, 21, 55]) # = 91
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#example-counting" id="example-counting">Example: Counting</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-python"># count_big_strings : ListOfStrings -&gt; Nat
# Count the number of strings that have at least 10 letters
def count_big_strings(list_of_strings):
    count = 0 # We have 0 big strings by default

    for s in list_of_strings: # Loop over every string `s` in the list
        if len(s) &gt;= 10: # This will check if the condition is true
            count += 1 # And run this code if it is true, hence the name
    
    return count # Return the result, outside of the for and if statement
</code></pre>
