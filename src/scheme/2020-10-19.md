## Starting where we left off last week

Below is the code we have written for the text editor last week:

```scheme
; A TextEditor is a (make-te String Nat)
(define-struct te [text cursor])
; and represents a text editor
; - where text is the text you have typed
; - and cursor is the index of the cursor

(define TE-EMPTY (make-te "" 0))
(define TE1 (make-te "hello" 1))
(define TE2 (make-te "ECS" 0))

; insert-text : TextEditor KeyEvent -> TextEditor
; Insert text the user typed at the cursor's location
(check-expect (insert-text TE1 "a")l
              (make-te "haello" 2))
(check-expect (insert-text TE2 "right")
              (make-te "ECS" 1))
```

We had created a simple structure for the text editor which can hold
both the text and the cursor position.

We have accidentally skipped a step between the `TextEditor` structure and the
`insert-text` function. We need to make a template.

### TextEditor template

We are now going to design the template.
See [ECS Help Sheet's `Designing Templates` section](#designing-templates).

```scheme
(define (te-template te)
    (... (te-text te)
         (te-cursor te)
         ...))
```

Since both of these are `primitives` or things that we have not defined ourselves,
we do not have to call or make any more templates, we can just use them directly.

### Figuring out what stays the same

> See: [ECS Help Sheet's `Designing Programs` section](#designing-programs) for more information on
designing a program

Lets make some constants. We know that the background will stay the same, so lets make that

```scheme
(define BACKGROUND (rectangle 600 200 "solid" "light blue"))
```

We also know that the font color, font size, and an image for the cursor will stay the same:

```scheme
(define FONT-COLOR "black")
(define FONT-SIZE 20)
(define CURSOR-IMAGE (rectangle 2 50 "solid" "black"))
```

> Remember, we can always come back and define more constants, these are just the ones we
can think of right now. And remember, putting things in constants will help a lot since you only
have to change them in one spot, and not all over your program if you want to change their value

### Figuring out what clauses we need

Now that we have some constants, we can move to step 2. We need to figure out what
clauses we need.
We will probably need `to-draw` so that we can draw the world, we want `on-mouse` so that we can
click and move the cursor around, and lastly we want `on-key` so we can capture the user's typing
and display it.

### Our main function

Finally, we are here!!1! We can design our main function. Lets call this `microsoft-word`
(this might violate tons of copyright, but we are too cool for copyright law). We also need to figure
out what goes in and what comes out. With most all main functions, they will take in the `WorldState`
and return a `WorldState`. And now, we can put it all together with a nice description as well

```scheme
; microsoft-word : TextEditor -> TextEditor
; Starts up a text editor where you can move the cursor
(define (microsoft-word initial-editor)
    (big-bang initial-editor
              [to-draw draw-text-editor]
              [on-mouse curse-of-the-cursor] ; Remember, these can be named whatever we want, as
                                             ; long as we know what they mean
              [on-key insert-text]))
```

Now that we have the main function and a wishlist of all the functions we want, we can make their function
signatures so we know what we want later when we design them.

#### Function signatures

Lets define our `draw-text-editor` signature. Since it is the `to-draw` handler, it takes in the
`WorldState` and outputs the drawn `Image`. We can put it in a nice old comment with a description

```scheme
; draw-text-editor : TextEditor -> Image
; Draws the text with the cursor at a certain position
```

Now that we have `draw-text-editor`, we can define the `curse-of-the-cursor`. This function will be
in the clause `on-mouse`. Because of that, it gives us some special things. As always, it will give
us the `WorldState` and it will also give us the x and y coordinate of the mouse and a `MouseEvent`
defining what the mouse did, and it returns a new modified (or not) `WorldState`. We can plop that
into a handy comment for us.

```scheme
; curse-of-the-cursor : TextEditor Number Number MouseEvent -> TextEditor
; Change the position of the cursor when you click
```

And we had already created the `insert-text` function last week:

```scheme
; insert-text : TextEditor KeyEvent -> TextEditor
; Insert text the user typed at the cursor's location
```

#### Defining functions

Now that we have all of the signatures in our wish list, we can start writing the functions.

We can start with the `draw-text-editor` function. As always, we need to start with some check expects.

```scheme
(check-expect
    (draw-text-editor TE-EMPTY)
    (overlay (beside CURSOR_IMAGE (text " " FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; This will create the blank image
                                                                   ; with just a cursor
    BACKGROUND))
(check-expect
    (draw-text-editor TE1)
    (overlay 
        (beside (text "h"  FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)
                CURSOR_IMAGE
                (text "ello" FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; Here we put the cursor between the `h` and
                                                    ; `ello` since it is a cursor pos 1
    BACKGROUND))
```

Now we can go and define the `draw-text-editor` function body.
So, we want to have 2 states, either there is no text in the editor, or there is some text.
we can check for such using a `cond`.

```scheme
(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [...]
          [...]))
```

Now we need to somehow get the text out of the editor structure. We can do so by using our template.
Lets paste it down here so we can use it.

```scheme
(define (te-template te)
    (... (te-text te)
         (te-cursor te)
         ...))
```

To access the text, we can use the `te-text` helper function from our template.
So we can paste it into the first cond. We need to check it to make sure that its length is > 0, meaning
it is not empty

```scheme
(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(> (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)] ; new
          [...]))
```

Now we can define a simple template of what we will do. Remember, we want to write some text,
the cursor, and then the rest of the text

```scheme
(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(> (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)
           (overlay (beside (text ... FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)    ; new
                            CURSOR-IMAGE                       ; new
                            (text ... FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR))   ; new
                    BACKGROUND)]                               ; new
          [...]))
```

Now, we need to figure out how to draw the text in front of the cursor. We can get a slice of
a string by using the `substring` function, and use the cursor position to chop it. We want to get the
`substring` of the `te-text` from 0 up until `te-cursor`

```scheme
(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(> (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)
           (overlay (beside (text (substring (te-text editor) 0 ; new
                                             (te-cursor))       ; new
                                   FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)
                            CURSOR-IMAGE
                            (text ...))
                    BACKGROUND)]
          [...]))
```

And now that we have the first text, we can do the second text very much the same, except this time,
we don't need to give `substring` an ending point, because in doing so, `substring` will just go
until the end.

```scheme
(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(> (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)
           (overlay (beside (text (substring (te-text editor) 0
                                             (te-cursor))
                                   FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)
                            CURSOR-IMAGE
                            (text (substring (te-text editor)   ; new
                                             (te-cursor))       ; new
                                  FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR))
                    BACKGROUND)]
          [...]))
```

Now that we have the text having state, we can work on the section of the function when there
is no text to draw. Since we will draw the same thing every time you have no text, we can extract it
into a constant. We can copy it from our first check expect

```scheme
(define BLANK-EDITOR-IMAGE
        (overlay (beside CURSOR_IMAGE (text " " FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; This will create the blank
                                                                       ; image with just a cursor
        BACKGROUND))
```

and then update our check expect from

```scheme
(check-expect
    (draw-text-editor TE-EMPTY)
    (overlay (beside CURSOR_IMAGE (text " " FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; This will create the blank image
                                                                   ; with just a cursor
    BACKGROUND))
```

to

```scheme
(check-expect
    (draw-text-editor TE-EMPTY)
    BLANK-EDITOR-IMAGE) ; changed
```

and we can add that into our new function

```scheme
(define (draw-text-editor editor)
    (cond [(> (string-length (te-text editor)) 0)
           (overlay (beside (text (substring (te-text editor) 0
                                             (te-cursor))
                                   FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)
                            CURSOR-IMAGE
                            (text (substring (te-text editor)
                                             (te-cursor))
                                  FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR))
                    BACKGROUND)]
          [else BLANK-EDITOR-IMAGE])) ; new
```

## Too Long; Didn't Read

- USE YOUR [ECS Help Sheet](#file-2-ecs-help-sheet-md).
It will walk you through it all.
- Make constants! they will help you keep duplicated code to a minimum,
and will save you when you need to change them.
- Complex programs can be broken down into simpler parts and are a lot easier
when you do so
- WRITE COMMENTS. Since we were unable to finish the text editor today, we will thank
ourselves later when we have to come back to it, that we have left comments telling us about
what we still need to do. (Your memory can only serve you so well)
