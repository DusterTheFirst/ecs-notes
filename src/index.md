# Hello ECS Students

This is a bunch of notes taken from the classes if you want
to read through them again

There is a sidebar that is on the right or accessible using the top right button in
the header

All notes are written by Zachary Kohnen, the Student Assistant for Orange block, so all of the dates
are for the orange block that those notes were taken on

If you have any questions about the content or improvements, you can check out the source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/ecs-notes) or email me at `21kohnenz@wpsraiders.org`
